Most apps should start with [Spectrum](https://photon.codes/docs/spectrum-ts/getting-started). It gives you one API across iMessage, WhatsApp Business, and other channels. Use `@photon-ai/advanced-imessage` directly when you need low-level iMessage features that Spectrum does not expose.

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#before-you-start)  Before You Start

You need three things: a runtime, Photon credentials, and a recipient that can receive iMessage.

### [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#runtime)  Runtime

Use Node.js `>=18.17` or Bun. If you are using Node, check your version first:

```
node --version
```

### [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#photon-credentials)  Photon Credentials

Copy these two values:

| Value | Format |
| --- | --- |
| Server address | `host:port`, for example `"imessage.example.com:443"` |
| Bearer token | A token string for the server |

The server address is only the host and port. Do not include `https://`. For the first working example, put the server address directly in `send.ts`.

Put the bearer token in an environment variable. Do not commit it to source control.

macOS/Linux

Windows PowerShell

```
export IMESSAGE_TOKEN="your-token"
```

```
$env:IMESSAGE_TOKEN="your-token"
```

This sets the variable only for the current terminal session. If you close the terminal, set it again. In production, set `IMESSAGE_TOKEN` through your deployment platform or secret manager.

### [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#recipient)  Recipient

Prepare an address that can receive iMessage:

- an email address, such as `alice@example.com`
- an E.164 phone number, such as `+15551234567`

The example below uses that address to create a chat, then sends a message to the returned `chat.guid`.

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#install)  Install

npm

pnpm

yarn

bun

```
npm install @photon-ai/advanced-imessage
```

```
pnpm add @photon-ai/advanced-imessage
```

```
yarn add @photon-ai/advanced-imessage
```

```
bun add @photon-ai/advanced-imessage
```

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#send-your-first-message)  Send Your First Message

The first send has three steps:

1. **Create a client** with your server address and token.
2. **Resolve the recipient** with `im.chats.create(...)`. This gives you a `chat.guid`.
3. **Send text** with `im.messages.sendText(...)`.

Create `send.ts`, then replace `imessage.example.com:443` and `alice@example.com`:

```
import { createClient } from "@photon-ai/advanced-imessage";

const im = createClient({
  address: "imessage.example.com:443",
  token: process.env.IMESSAGE_TOKEN!,
});

try {
  // Message APIs need chat.guid, not the raw email address or phone number.
  const { chat } = await im.chats.create(["alice@example.com"]);

  const message = await im.messages.sendText(chat.guid, "Hello from the SDK");
  console.log(message.guid);
} finally {
  await im.close();
}
```

`im.chats.create(...)` returns a server chat GUID. Direct chats and group chats use different shapes:

| Chat type | GUID shape | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct chat | `any;-;{recipient}` | `any;-;alice@example.com` |
| Group chat | `any;+;{group-id}` | `any;+;group-id` |

Message APIs take `chat.guid`, not the raw email address or phone number:

```
await im.messages.sendText(chat.guid, "Hello from the SDK");
```

### [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#run-it)  Run It

Node.js can run TypeScript through [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx). Bun runs `.ts` files directly.

npm

pnpm

yarn

bun

```
npx tsx send.ts
```

```
pnpm dlx tsx send.ts
```

```
yarn dlx tsx send.ts
```

```
bun send.ts
```

On success, the script prints `message.guid`. Seeing that GUID means the message was accepted and sent.

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#client-options)  Client Options

`createClient(...)` accepts these options:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `address` | `string` | Yes | Server address in `host:port` format. Do not include `https://`. |
| `token` | `string` | Yes | Bearer token. |
| `tls` | `boolean` | No | Encrypt the gRPC connection. Defaults to `true`; keep the default for hosted servers. |
| `timeout` | `number` | No | Timeout, in milliseconds, for unary requests. Streams stay open. |
| `retry` | `boolean | RetryOptions` | No | Retry retryable unary failures. Streams are not retried automatically. |

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#sdk-overview)  SDK Overview

The client is organized by resource:

| Namespace | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `im.messages` | Send text, attachments, mini app cards, multipart messages, replies, reactions, stickers, edits, unsends, list queries, and message events |
| `im.chats` | Create chats, read chat state, count chats, mark read, set typing, share contact cards, and manage chat backgrounds |
| `im.groups` | Rename groups, manage participants, set group icons, and leave groups |
| `im.attachments` | Upload files, read metadata, and stream downloads |
| `im.polls` | Create polls, vote, unvote, add options, and subscribe to poll events |
| `im.addresses` | Check address metadata, Focus silence state, and iMessage availability |
| `im.locations` | Read Find My shared friend locations, request location sharing, and watch live updates |
| `im.events` | Replay durable events after a disconnect |

## [​](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/getting-started\#next-steps)  Next Steps

Core path:

1. [Messages](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/messages) — send text, attachments, mini app cards, multipart messages, reactions, edits, unsends, and subscribe to message events
2. [Chats](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/chats) — create chats, mark read, set typing, and manage chat backgrounds
3. [Events](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/events) — catch up on durable events after a disconnect
4. [Error Handling](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/error-handling) — understand error classes, retries, and idempotency keys

Use as needed:

- [Groups](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/groups) — manage group names, participants, icons, and leaving
- [Attachments](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/attachments) — upload files, read metadata, and stream downloads
- [Polls](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/polls) — create polls, vote, and subscribe to poll events
- [Addresses](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/addresses) — check addresses, Focus state, and iMessage availability
- [Locations](https://photon.codes/docs/advanced-kits/imessage/locations) — read Find My shared friend locations and request location sharing
